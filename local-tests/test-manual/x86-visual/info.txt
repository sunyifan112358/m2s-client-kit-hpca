This tests runs the 'test-threads' mini-benchmark with an x86 detailed
simulation and option '--trace' active. The trace is then consumed by the
visualization tool with a call to 'm2s --visual'.

You should observe an M2S-Visual window opening with an x86 CPU panel with 4
cores and the default memory hierarchy. You should be able to navigate through
cycles, timing diagrams, and cache memory representations without problems.
