warning: path .* has been redirected to
	path .* while loading runtime 'm2s-opencl-old'\.
	The dynamic linker of your application seems to be accessing a
	runtime library\. A copy of this runtime library has been found
	in '\$\(TOPDIR\)/lib/\.libs', while running Multi2Sim from its
	build tree root\. As a safer and portable option, please link
	your guest program statically with the corresponding runtime\.

warning: evg_opencl_clCreateProgramWithSource_impl: binary 'vector-add\.bin' used as pre-compiled kernel\.
	You have selected a pre-compiled OpenCL kernel binary to be passed to your
	OpenCL application when it requests a kernel compilation\. It is your
	responsibility to check that the chosen binary corresponds to the kernel
	that your application is expecting to load\.
