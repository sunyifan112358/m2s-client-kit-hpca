warning: Multi2Sim OpenCL library running on native mode\.
	You are running on the real machine an OpenCL program linked with
	Multi2Sim's OpenCL runtime \(libm2s-opencl\.so\)\. In native mode, the only
	device visible to the application is the x86 CPU\. If you want to see
	additional devices, please run your application on Multi2Sim\. If you want
	to run your program using native libraries, please compile it with flag
	'-lOpenCL' instead of '-lm2s-opencl'\.

fatal: clBuildProgram: runtime kernel compilation not supported\.
	Your guest OpenCL application is trying to compile an OpenCL kernel
	by calling function 'clCreateProgramWithSource'\. Dynamic kernel
	compilation is currently not supported\. The following two
	alternatives are suggested instead:

	1\) If you are running a benchmark from the AMD APPSDK suite, you can
	   add option '--load <file>' to the benchmark command line\. This
	   option is supported by all benchmarks in the suite, and it allows
	   you to specify a precompiled kernel binary that will be loaded by
	   the application using 'clCreateProgramWithBinary'\. Notice that
	   this is an option for the benchmark, and not for the simulator\.

	2\) You can force the Multi2Sim runtime to load a specific kernel
	   binary every time the application performs a call to
	   'clCreateProgramWithSource' by setting environment varaible
	   'M2S_OPENCL_BINARY' to the path of a pre-compiled binary that
	   will be passed to the application\.
