warning: Multi2Sim OpenCL library running on native mode\.
	You are running on the real machine an OpenCL program linked with
	Multi2Sim's OpenCL runtime \(libm2s-opencl\.so\)\. In native mode, the only
	device visible to the application is the x86 CPU\. If you want to see
	additional devices, please run your application on Multi2Sim\. If you want
	to run your program using native libraries, please compile it with flag
	'-lOpenCL' instead of '-lm2s-opencl'\.

warning: clBuildProgram: vector-add-x86\.bin: program binary loaded for device 'Multi2Sim 32-bit x86 CPU Model'\.
	Your guest OpenCL application has successfully loaded the program
	binary passed through environment variable 'M2S_OPENCL_BINARY'
	after a call to 'clCreateProgramWithSource'\. While this works,
	a safer option is loading directly from the application with a
	call to 'clCreateProgramWithBinary'\.
