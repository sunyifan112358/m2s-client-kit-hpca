warning: path .* has been redirected to
	path .* while loading runtime 'OpenCL'\.
	The dynamic linker of your application seems to be accessing a
	runtime library\. A copy of this runtime library has been found
	in '\$\(TOPDIR\)/lib/\.libs', while running Multi2Sim from its
	build tree root\. As a safer and portable option, please link
	your guest program statically with the corresponding runtime\.

warning: clBuildProgram: vector-add\.bin: program binary loaded for device 'Multi2Sim Southern Islands GPU Model'\.
	Your guest OpenCL application has successfully loaded the program
	binary passed through environment variable 'M2S_OPENCL_BINARY'
	after a call to 'clCreateProgramWithSource'\. While this works,
	a safer option is loading directly from the application with a
	call to 'clCreateProgramWithBinary'\.
